    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong">Filtlong, a tool for filtering long reads by quality</a>. Filtlong can take a set of long reads and produce a smaller, better subset. It uses both read length (longer is better) and read identity (higher is better) when choosing which reads pass the filter.</p>

    <p>More details on Filtlong can be found on its Github page [1].</p>
